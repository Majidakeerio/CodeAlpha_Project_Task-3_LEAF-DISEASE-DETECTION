# CodeAlpha_Project_Task-3_LEAF-DISEASE-DETECTION

Introduction
Disease detection in plants is a crucial aspect of agriculture. This project aims to provide an image-based automatic inspection system that can help farmers and agricultural professionals identify diseases in plants at an early stage. By leveraging image processing and deep learning techniques, the system categorizes plant leaves as either healthy or infected.
