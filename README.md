# CodeAlpha_Project_Task-3_LEAF-DISEASE-DETECTION

Introduction
Disease detection in plants is a crucial aspect of agriculture. This project aims to provide an image-based automatic inspection system that can help farmers and agricultural professionals identify diseases in plants at an early stage. By leveraging image processing and deep learning techniques, the system categorizes plant leaves as either healthy or infected.

Features
Automatic Detection: Automatically detects whether a plant leaf is healthy or infected using images.
Deep Learning: Utilizes deep learning techniques to classify leaf images accurately.
Image Processing: Applies self-designed image processing methods to enhance detection accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface for uploading leaf images and getting instant results.
